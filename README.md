# Step Counter Web App

This web app is a step counter that helps users keep track of their daily physical activity.
It uses a JSON data to count the number of steps taken by the user.
The app provides a dashboard that shows the number of steps of the current day and the current month, along with a nice visualization using D3.js.
In addition, it displays some other useful information such as the best and worst day,
the average steps per day, the total steps for the last 28 days, and the total steps so far for the current day.

The app is built using HTML, CSS (SCSS), and Vanilla JS, with D3.js used for data visualization.
The code is modular and follows best practices in web development.
The app is responsive and works well on different devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
